### Versioning

{{site.name}} uses a simple versioning system:

{{site.project}}-A.B.C.jar

- C - Critical bug resolutions.
- B - Feature added + bug resolutions.
- A - Tons of features or public API change.

### Download

We deploy our jars to Maven Central Repository, so you can easily add it as dependency:

#### Gradle

        compile '{{site.group-id}}:{{site.project}}:{{site.last_release}}'
    }

#### SBT

    libraryDependencies += "{{site.group-id}}" % "{{site.project}}" % "{{site.last_release}}"

#### Ivy

    <dependency org="{{site.group-id}}" name="{{site.project}}" rev="{{site.last_release}}"/>

#### Maven 

    <dependency>
        <groupId>{{site.group-id}}</groupId>
        <artifactId>{{site.project}}</artifactId>
